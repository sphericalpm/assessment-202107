        <p>Essentially, a Terms and Conditions agreement is a contract between your business and the user of your
          website
          or app - whether they are an individual or a business. You may see Terms and Conditions agreements referred to
          as Terms of Service (ToS) or Terms of Use (ToU). There's no practical difference between these terms and
          companies use them interchangeably.</p>

        <p>Having a Terms and Conditions agreement is not a legal requirement, but having one is important as they
          protect
          your business and create a set of rules that anyone using your app or website must agree to.</p>

        <p>Without a Terms and Conditions agreement your business and customers are lacking clearly defined rights,
          responsibilities and duties. This could lead to costly disagreements. For example, businesses lacking a
          payment
          clause in their Terms and Conditions agreements may receive late payments which affects the business's cash
          flow
          and leads to money and time spent on debt collectors.</p>
